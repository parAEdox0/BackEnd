flash messages 

 -> Whenever we want to provide a message or information or error of any kind on an ejs page we use flash messages
    they can be alerts, warning, messages 

 -> example
    the warning we get if we enter wrong credentials while logging in on any website

 install connect-flash (npm i connect-flash)

 CANNOT USE CONNECT_FLASH WITHOUT CREATING A EXPRESS SESSION

 put connect-flash in app.use function


 -> flash message allows us to use the data created in a specific route to any of the other route which is not possible otherwise
