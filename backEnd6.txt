database

 ->database is a collection of data of any kind
 ->there are two types of databases
   - relational -> sql/mySql
   - non relational -> mongoDb

 ->mongoDb

    database Setup(code) => database Formation(db)
    model(code) => collection(db)
    schema(code) => documents(db)

    collections are the parts of the database for example we have amazon database and in it there are various parts of that database for example user data, admin data, product data etc these parts are called as collections and is made using coding models

    and in one collection there are multiple elements for example user collection has various users 

    each user from the collection is called as documents in db

    steps
     -install mongoDb 
     -install mongoose (npm i mongoose)
     -connect
       const mongoose = require("mongoose");

      //creates database
      mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/database");

      //creates document for each module of collection
      const userSchema = mongoose.Schema({
        username: String,
        name: String,
        age: Number
      })

      //creates collection mongoose.model(collection name, schema)
      module.exports = mongoose.model("user", userSchema);


cookie and session

 -> cookie and session both are data
 -> if data is stored in client i.e. browser it is called       as cookie
 -> if it is stored in server it is called as session

 -> to use session
    -install (npm i express-session)
    -sessions is written in app.js
    -(const session = require("express-session"))
    -(app.use(session)({
      resave: false,
      saveUninitialized: false,
      secret: "anythingRandom"
    }))

    -create
     req.session.koibhinaam = koibhivalue;

    -read
     req.session.koibhinaam

    -delete
     req.session.destroy


-> to use cookie
   cookie-parser (already installed by express-generator)
   to create the cookie
    -res.cookie(naam, value)

   to view the cookie 
    -console.log(req.cookies)

   to delete the cookie
    -res.clearCookie(value)
